## **Tic-tac-toe**

This project makes a bowser version of the tic-tac-toc game. The game implemented here can be played by two human players or against a bot. The bot is invincible, meaning that the possible outcomes of the game are a tie or a victory by the bot. The bot was made invincible with the minimax algorithm.

The main objective of this project was implementing factory funcions and working with the module pattern.

Additionally, I implemented two splash pages for inputing the name of the players and let them select their avatar. The original avarats were made with an avatar creater (https://getavataaars.com/). They are free for personal and commercial use.
